# Fixes Summary - Alchemy Integration Issues

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Token Amount Display ✅
**Problem**: Showing dollar value instead of token count
**Status**: Already correct in code
**Code**: `Number(amount) / 1e18` in ResultsView.tsx
**Note**: The display should show token amounts. If you're seeing dollar values, it might be a different issue.

### Issue 2: Not Finding Source ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Couldn't find incoming transfers even though they exist on Basescan
**Root Cause**: Was searching from `fromBlock` instead of from block 0
**Fix**: Changed to search from genesis block (0x0)

**Before:**
```typescript
fromBlock: `0x${fromBlock.toString(16)}`, // Only searched recent blocks
```

**After:**
```typescript
fromBlock: '0x0', // Search ALL history from genesis
```

This ensures we find transfers no matter how old they are.

### Issue 3: Alchemy SDK Parameters ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Incorrect parameters for Alchemy API
**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Network Mapping**: Added proper Base network support
```typescript
'base-mainnet': Network.BASE_MAINNET,
```

2. **Sorting Order**: Fixed type error
```typescript
order: SortingOrder.ASCENDING, // Was: 'asc' (wrong type)
```

3. **Decimal Handling**: Properly parse token decimals
```typescript
const decimals = parseInt(transfer.rawContract.decimal || '0x12', 16);
const rawValue = ethers.parseUnits(transfer.value.toString(), decimals);
```

4. **Search Range**: Always search from block 0
```typescript
fromBlock: '0x0', // Start from genesis
toBlock: `0x${toBlock.toString(16)}`, // Up to current block
```

## Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging to help debug:

```typescript
this.log(`Using Alchemy fast API for transfers (searching from block 0 to ${toBlock})`);
this.log(`Alchemy API returned ${response.transfers.length} transfers instantly`);
this.log(`  Transfer: ${from}... → ${to}... (${value} tokens, block ${blockNum})`);
this.log(`⚠️ No transfers found for ${address}... - wallet may have never received this token`);
this.log(`❌ Alchemy API failed: ${error}`);
```

## What You Should See Now

### In the Logs:
```
Using Alchemy fast API for transfers (searching from block 0 to 36230279)
Alchemy API returned 5 transfers instantly
  Transfer: 0x1234... → 0x4735... (100.5 tokens, block 35000000)
  Transfer: 0x5678... → 0x4735... (50.2 tokens, block 35500000)
  ...
```

### If No Transfers Found:
```
⚠️ No transfers found for 0x4735... - wallet may have never received this token
```

This means:
- The wallet never received this specific token, OR
- The token address is incorrect, OR
- There's an API issue (will fall back to RPC)

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Search starts from block 0 (finds old transfers)
2. ✅ Proper network mapping for Base
3. ✅ Correct decimal handling
4. ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
5. ✅ Fallback to RPC if Alchemy fails

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Unknown" Origin
**Possible Causes:**
1. Wallet never received tokens (check Basescan)
2. Seller is a contract (stops at contract)
3. API returned 0 transfers
4. Wrong token address

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check detailed logs (expand "Show Details")
2. Verify token address is correct
3. Check if seller address exists on Basescan
4. Verify network is correct (base-mainnet)

### "Over 55 years ago"
**Cause**: Timestamp is 0 (not fetched)
**Status**: Known issue - timestamps not critical for tracing
**Fix**: Can be added if needed

### Alchemy API Fails
**Fallback**: Automatically uses standard RPC
**Log**: "Falling back to standard RPC method..."
**Impact**: Slower but still works

## Network Configuration

Make sure your Alchemy configuration uses:
- **Network**: `base-mainnet` (for Base)
- **API Key**: Your Alchemy API key
- **Provider**: `alchemy`

The app will automatically map this to `Network.BASE_MAINNET` in the SDK.

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check detailed logs (click "Show Details")
3. Verify token address is correct
4. Ensure network is set to "base-mainnet"
5. Check if transfers exist on Basescan for that wallet + token

## Example Debug Output

```
12:30:00 - Initializing Blockchain Service

12:30:00 - Alchemy SDK initialized for fast transfers API

12:30:01 - Token Tracer

12:30:01 - Token Tracer
[Depth 0] Searching for first incoming transfer to 0x4735...1fc7...

12:30:01 - Blockchain API
Using Alchemy fast API for transfers (searching from block 0 to 36230279)

12:30:02 - Blockchain API
Alchemy API returned 3 transfers instantly

12:30:02 - Blockchain API
  Transfer: 0xabcd... → 0x4735... (213.5653 tokens, block 35123456)

12:30:02 - Token Tracer
  Found 3 incoming transfer(s) for 0x4735...1fc7

12:30:02 - Token Tracer
[Depth 0] Found transfer from 0xabcd... at block 35123456

12:30:02 - Token Tracer
[Depth 0] → Recursively tracing 0xabcd...
```

If you see "0 transfers" but Basescan shows transfers, there's likely a mismatch in:
- Token address
- Network
- Wallet address
